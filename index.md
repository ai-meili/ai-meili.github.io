### AllLife Bank Customer Segmentation 
In this academic project, AllLife Bank's marketing research team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers in addition to upselling to existing customers. In this project, I conducted a customer segmentation analysis by clustering customers into groups dependent upon the centroid value of each feature, defining clear and targetable market audiences to develop designated marketing campaigns. <br><br>

### Early detection of Alzheimer's through examination of varied language usage in an author's published works

During my undergraduate career, one of the earliest academic projects I completed examined the relationship between Alzheimer's and the variability of language in an author's published works over time. This project was able to successfully replicate the findings of Garrard et al. (2005) in their study of Iris Murdoch, who showed a progressive clear-cut decline in lexical diversity.<br><br>

Being a retrospective analysis, I chose an author diagnosed with Alzheimer's to examine. I downloaded eBooks from Project Gutenberg and wrote a program in Python to remove spaces, parse text, and remove punctuation from the works in order to retrieve raw vocabulary. Subsequently, I wrote a different program in Python to count and keep track of varied vocabulary in each published work. Lastly, I created a data visualization in order to exemplify how the number of varied words declined over time.
