### AllLife Bank Customer Segmentation 
In this academic project, AllLife Bank's marketing research team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers in addition to upselling to existing customers. In this project, I conducted a customer segmentation analysis by clustering customers into groups dependent upon the centroid value of each feature, defining clear and targetable market audiences to develop designated marketing campaigns. <br><br>

### Early detection of Alzheimer's through examination of varied language usage in an author's published works

During my undergraduate career, one of the earliest academic projects I completed examined the relationship between Alzheimer's and the variability of language in an author's published works over time. This project was able to successfully replicate the findings of Garrard et al. (2005) in their study of Iris Murdoch, who showed a progressive clear-cut decline in lexical diversity.<br><br>

Being a retrospective analysis, I chose an author diagnosed with Alzheimer's to examine. I downloaded eBooks from Project Gutenberg and wrote a program in Python to remove spaces, parse text, and remove punctuation from the works in order to retrieve raw vocabulary. Subsequently, I wrote a different program in Python to count and keep track of varied vocabulary in each published work. Lastly, I created a data visualization in order to exemplify how the number of varied words declined over time.

### Liability to Asset Customer Conversion in the Banking Environment

In this dataset, the mmajority of a bank's customers are liability customers (depositors) with very few doubling as borrowers (asset customers). The bank is interested in expanding loan business in order to increase profits through interest garnered on personal loans. In this project, I analyzed data using different techniques such as Linear Regression and Decision Tree Classifiers to build a predictive model for the next marketing campaign, offering insight and business recommendations. <br><br>

**Figure 2**: Confusion Matrix run on the testing data during initializtion of the ML algorithm. The Confusion Matrix displays only 9% accuracy, indicating that accuracy is not a good metric for evaluatio when measuring the data.
